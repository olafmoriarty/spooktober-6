## Art assets

### Background
**NOTE:** The game is partially in grayscale. Both the background image and the character sprites should work in grayscale.

With the exception of cutscenes, the entire game takes place in Zoey's bedroom. It is late in the evening, and the only illumination in the room is candles.

It is an advantage if the background image has a wide format, e.g. something in the neighborhood of a 3:1 ratio, as that would make it possible to pan the background back and forth depending on which character is talking.

The room's owner is a fifteen year old middle-class girl, and her bedroom should reflect that. Not too messy, but not spotless either. Posters on the walls, maybe a TV set, some chairs, a mirror, furniture that holds her clothes and makeup. She's a soccer player, so she may have shelves of soccer effects and trophies. She considers herself to be a queen bee and tries to appear as cool as she can, so she wouldn't be the type to have a lot of stuffed animals (at least not on public display).

### Character sprites
**NOTE:** The game is partially in grayscale. Both the background image and the character sprites should work in grayscale.

All the characters are teen girls (15-ish).

* **Zoey** is the confident Blair Waldorf-type who considers herself to be the leader of the group. She takes good care of her hair and skin and wears above-average-priced clothes. Probably has pierced ears.
* * **Moods**: Calm, Annoyed, Scared
* **Amelia** is an African-American girl. She's mostly relaxed and happy, and while she's friends with the rest of the group for historical reasons and doesn't mind hanging out with them, she's being herself, speaking her mind, and doesn't care too much about impressing Zoey. Wears thick-framed glasses and comfortable clothes.
* * **Moods**: Neutral/bored, Happy, Annoyed, Surprised
* **Natalie** is a blonde people pleaser with low self-esteem. She's more afraid of ghosts than she wants to admit, and since this is a game about speaking to ghosts, she's always a bit on the edge. She always tries to impress Zoey, wears clothes that she thinks Zoey would like and so on. Could have long hair and a hairband, maybe freckles.
* * **Moods:** Nervous, Calm, Scared, Possessed (angry, no pupils in her eyes, maybe sort of glowing)
* **Mia:** A ghost. Is invisible for most of the story, but gains visibility in the final chapter. Short hair. While her head should look very human so that the others can recognize who she is, the rest of her body *could* be a nondescript floating blob. If we can clearly see her clothes, she's wearing a plaid flannel shirt (**important**). Since she's a ghost, I'm imagining that she's semi-transparent (it doesn't really matter if the sprites themselves are transparent or not, that can be fixed in code)
* * **Moods:** Shocked (only used when she first realizes she's visible, could e.g. be her looking down at her hands in visible surprise), Rage, Calm 

### Cutscene frames
The game contains several cutscenes that consist of still images with accompanying text. These could be in a 4:3 ratio or somewhere in that area (though it is preferrable that all images are the same size.) These images are the main character's memories, and don't *have to* be drawn in the same style as the sprites (and it may look good to intentionally use rough sketches here), but some of the characters from the sprites appear in these images and should preferrably be recognizable.

#### First cutscene
* We see a small forest. It is winter, and it is snowing.
* It's snowing. We see a person wearing a plaid flannel shirt and a jacket running through the snow into the forest, as if chased by something. We can't see their face and can't tell their age or gender in this image.
* We see a boot stepping on a frozen lake, with the result that the ice is cracking.
* There's now a big hole in the ice, and we see that a person has stepped through the ice and is drowning. We see just their silhouette so that we can't tell who they are.

#### Second cutscene
**NOTE** - In this and the next cutscene, Mia is **alive**. Also, until otherwise stated, she is *not* wearing the plaid flannel shirt she's wearing in her sprite, but something else.

* Mia and Amelia are happily having a conversation in a hallway at a public school. Probably next to lockers or something.

#### Third cutscene *(the long one)*
**NOTE** - Hailey has no sprites and thus is not one of the characters described above, but she should be Mia's age, give or take a year.

* Mia and her girlfriend Hailey are lying on a bed together in Hailey's room, talking and holding hands, after spending an afternoon together. In case it's not obvious, both of them are fully dressed. I think it could look cool if they're lying head-to-feed while holding hands, but it's not important and they could be lying side by side, too.
* Hailey sits up on the edge of the bed, still talking to Mia.
* Close-up of Mia lying in bed, smiling and talking. She is very much in love.
* Hailey is standing by a mini-fridge, still in the same room, and getting something out of the fridge. If we can see what she's getting, it's two cans of Coke. She's still talking to Hailey while doing this.
* Mia has stood up and is standing close to Hailey, getting ready to leave. She's getting closer to Hailey to kiss her goodbye, but we can see that she's holding a Coke can in her hands and is about to open it.
* Mia opens the Coke can, which has been shook a little too much, so it sprays brown soda all over her. She's shocked and disgusted as she's splashed with soda.
* Mia looks down at herself and sighs with seeing her top covered with soda. Hailey is either moving towards the room door or already at the door and reaching for something outside of it.
* Mia is changing clothes and is putting on a plaid flannel shirt. (She's either already buttoning the top button or we see her from above, we do *not* need to see the fifteen-year-old in her underwear.) Hailey smiles and laughs while talking to her.
* Cut to on the street outside of Hailey's apartment. It is winter, it is snowing, it is around 6 PM. Mia is wearing a jacket over the flannel shirt, but part of the shirt is clearly visible.
* Zoey comes running from behind and catches up with Mia. They smile and talk to each other happily.
* Zoey notices Mia's shirt and grabs the collar of it, looking a little angry. Mia looks defensive and a bit scared.
* Zoey is now yelling at Mia, and Mia looks more and more scared.
* Mia is running towards the same forest we saw in the first cutscene. Zoey is chasing her, like a predator hunts its prey.
* Mia has stepped through the frozen lake and is trying to get out of the water, screaming for help.
* Zoey has stopped and is standing in the snow next to the lake. She looks shocked, but doesn't know what to do, so she doesn't move. She does NOT look vicious or gleeful to see Mia in the water, she's just standing there, frozen, not sure what to do
* Mia is sinking in the water while Zoey is watching helplessly, incapable of acting.
